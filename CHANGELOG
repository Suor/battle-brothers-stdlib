1.6
- added Util.pack() and .unpack()
- added Table.deepExtend()
- added 3-param Text.plural()
- extended and fixed Debug.pp() and friends:
    - number passed instead of opts means `{depth = number}`
    - string passed instead of opts means `{filter = string}`
    - added `filter` option, only show keys containing this as a substring
    and their values
    - table keys are sorted
    - correctly overwrite all defaults when using `Debug.with()`
    - correctly expand to multiline when having a long `name = ` prefix
    - always show strings and tables with pp the same, no last depth bug
    anymore

1.5
- initial public release

... lost in ancient history ...
